When I received both this and the following one (Cambridge Boathouse) they were mixed up and named as Boston 1971 & 1973, but I think they were accidentally mis-labeled at some time. Why do I think this? Well, by doing a comparison of some tracks included in Precise Modern Lovers Order & also by checking out some other people's early Modern Lovers web pages: they tie in as actually being from Harvard University 1971 & Cambridge Boathouse. Quality-wise though, the recording sound is pretty rough, especially when you compare them to the cleaned up songs included on Precise Modern Lovers Order, but, because some are not included on either Precise Modern Lovers Order or Live at the Longbranch Saloon, then they are probably only available within this recording. So, that's my ten cents, enough said...",

Since Jonathan had had a "hit" with a full band, it raised an eyebrow that he was doing such a major show completely by himself. Since that time, Jonathan has done many shows solo, "with an amp the size of the toaster"-style. But for most of the last 20 years has preferred to have his drummer, Tommy, accompany his "solo" show.',

Some excellent guitar work is here too, especially on 'Chewing Gum Wrapper' and 'Conga Drums' - this is by far the best version of 'Conga Drums' that I've yet heard. Unfortunately, the tape runs out near the end of 'Walter Johnson', the shows second encore, just a couple of lines short of what would have been the end; so unfortunately, the recording comes to a bit of an abrupt ending - this though is probably the only slight flaw with the recording. Has a great atmosphere of an excellent show, superbly captured!!!",

There's a 1/2 second bit where some crowd noise, or something like that, cuts in over the top of the song, the track then continues as normal. That's how the CD arrived. Also, this show could be from the 10th August or 8th October, 1991, as it came labeled 10/8/91; I've gone for the August date here, but maybe someone has a ticket stub or flyer which would confirm the date either way?",

My best guess dates it as sometime in late 1991 - going by the song choices and Jonathan's comments between songs. An early version of 'Let Her Go Into The Darkness' is introduced here as a brand new song, \"not even on the new album that just came out\" - Possibly, 'Having A Party With Jonathan Richman' which, far as I know, was released in late September 1991. About half the show looks to be here - the taping cuts out straight after Jonathan calls an intermission.",

Tonight's show is in a small pub-type venue with a pretty tightly packed audience, well pretty tightly packed where we were anyway, of probably about 150 people, tops. There's a little bit of conversation picked up on this one, but not too much, and it sounds fine. Tonight's highlight is a great sounding 'Let Her Go Into The Darkness' with the full boyfriend/girlfriend argument done in all five languages... English, Spanish, French, Italian, and Hebrew... great fun! A bit of a special show for me too, coz it's the first one that I could take my daughter to: she's now just old enough to start going to see shows, so I was really pleased to be able to take her to a Jonathan one, and Yes, she had a great time too! Her words afterwards were... 'I enjoyed it loads...take me again!!'",
